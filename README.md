# Package Product Manager

MageRevolution's [Package Product Type](http://www.magerevolution.com/mr/magento-product-management-extensions/package-product-type), allows you to create package or kit products, comprised of multiple other products.

This extension provides advanced management and creation of Package Products, currently by way of CSV import.

## Road Map

Future plans include being able to create new package products from a filtered selection of existing simple products.
